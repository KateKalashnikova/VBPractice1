# VisualBasicPractice1
In this repo I practice creating a form using Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)/ Visual Basic.
## The form does the following:
* Input a name and get a message
* Exit out of form
* Input two values to sum or divide them and get a result ( for division, values can be decimal but the result will be rounded as Int type)
